        <h3 class="w3-center">ABOUT THE GROUP</h3>
        <p class="w3-center">Going into its fourth year, 116th & Partners LLC is an established, collaborative student led and financed fund on Columbia's campus that actively manages over $50,000.</p>
        <div class="w3-row-padding w3-center" style="margin-top:64px">
            <div class="w3-col m4">

                <p class="w3-large">Who We Are</p>
                <p>116th & Partners LLC is a student led and financed fund that seeks to provide real life investment experience and achieve above market returns. Officially founded over the summer of 2015, we are made up of passionate investors with a diverse background of financial experience. Started by three co-founders, the board has grown to be currently over 15 people with many former members now also working post-graduation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="w3-col m4">
                <i class="fa fa-book-open w3-margin-bottom w3-jumbo"></i>
                <p class="w3-large">Our Story</p>
                <p>116th & Partners LLC developed from the co-founders' yearning to have a unique investment opportunity on campus that included a portfolio made up of long and short positions, value and growth selections, as well as hedges and alternative investments. While the goal is undoubtedly to achieve above market returns, the group seeks to provide investment experience in various sectors of the market. Furthermore, with such a small group, each member will carry significant responsibility.</p>

                <p>While we were formerly known as Morningside Capital Partners LLC, as you can tell, we have changed our name to 116th & Partners LLC. Despite this change, it is worth noting that we still operate in the exact same manner as before. Please feel free to reach out to us on our "Contact" page with any inquiries or comments in regards to this amendment.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="w3-col m4">
                <i class="fa fa-lightbulb w3-margin-bottom w3-jumbo"></i>
                <p class="w3-large">Investment Philosophy</p>
                <p>116th & Partners takes a disciplined and diversified approach to their investment strategy. The fund is comprised of two portfolios - growth and value. Each portfolio has around 8-10 securities to ensure that every pick impacts our overall fund, yet risk is minimized by not having more than a 10% impact. The value fund will naturally have investments with longer time horizons that are selected for being deemed undervalued based on fundamental valuation techniques. The growth section will be more actively managed and will also include short positions and options. All profits will be reinvested.</p>

                <p>One member a week will be responsible for pitching a stock, which will be subsequently voted on by the board. To learn more about the voting process or meetings more generally, feel free to send us your inquiry in the "Contact" section.</p>
